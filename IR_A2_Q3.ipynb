My Session kit came with them and with the heavy 6 play maple toms have never had a single issue with tuning, bouncing, lug stress whatsoever.  I think after you use them for a while you can take them for granted and don't fully understand how sturdy they are until you use another suspension system.  I recently purchased a Pearl Birch Vision kit for my wife which came with Pearl's I.S.S. mounting system.  To be fair I've never used them, and in the case of the new kit they came right off, and the Optimounts went right on.  Even though these are not the aluminum (more expensive and slightly lighter) Masterworks version, I feel they not only work for what they're intended, but they also accent the drum shells without being intrusive.  Most drummers buy, skin, and play for sound, but showing off your nice wood shells never hurts.  I can't think of a single negative, except that they're not free.  :)\n",

The center mike holder opening is for a much larger microphone than the ATR 2100, that I own. The 2100 indicates 51mm, but that is at the mike area, not the trunk which is much smaller and used for mounting to the shock mount. After researching a replacement in the same price range, I found none. I had some foam pipe insulation for 1/2 inch pvc pipe in the utility room. This is readily available from most any big box hardware store.  I cut the foam about 4\" in length and placed the 2100 in the foam. It fits perfect. I didn't seal the foam, but it is just right and tight in the mount holder. I now have a shock mount that can be used if, and when, I purchase a larger microphone. I have attached a photo. After the image was created, I further trimmed the foam length to match the actual size of the mounting holder opening.  This shock mount is a quality product at a great price.\n",

As some other reviewers have commented this bass is not balanced as a standard solid body bass. the neck is definitely heavier due to the hollow body, but you know, that's the way it goes. I love the sound the hollow body gives you sounds a bit like my acoustic bass. The controls give a nice variety of sounds. I am something of a novice player but wanted to add a hollow body bass to my small collection and this Hofner replica is just the ticket. I think I might replace the strings that it came with as they sound a too metallic for my taste, but they are playable and hold tune well. I was able to play this bass right out of the box once I tuned it. No need for adjusting and didn't have that fret buss some reviewers have commented on. I did notice the neck is slimmer and the strings are closer together than any of my other basses, so that is an adjustment, but didn't take long to get into the swing of things. Fun to play and lightweight. Recommended.\n",

If they were an Active pickup without the BOOM sound, then I would say its a 4 star. Everything is about the same as the GSR200 as far as body, neck, and bridge. Mine was a $79 buy new and a $119 flip. Its an ok Bass guitar after a string change and a setup. This is more of a first time Bass buyer who is learning to play.\n",
